# Data Structures and Algorithms JS

## About

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS). The implementations are designed to be simple, readable, and idiomatic, rather than optimized for performance.

## Tools

- [Deno](https://deno.com/) - A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

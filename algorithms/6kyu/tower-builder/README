# Tower builder

Build Tower
Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "\*" character.

For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:

```
[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ",
  "*****"
]
And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:

[
  "     *     ",
  "    ***    ",
  "   *****   ",
  "  *******  ",
  " ********* ",
  "***********"
]
```

### Thinking

1. The first line has `n-1` spaces and `1` `*`
2. The second line has `n-2` spaces and `3` `*`
3. The third line has `n-3` spaces and `5` `*`
4. The fourth line has `n-4` spaces and `7` `*`
5. The fifth line has `n-5` spaces and `9` `*`

### Math Formula

Calculate the number of `*` in each line by `2 * i - 1` where `i` is the line number.

Calculate the number of spaces in each line by `n - i` where `n` is the total number of lines and `i` is the line number.

# Anagram Detection

An anagram is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new word (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)).

Note: anagrams are case insensitive

Complete the function to return `true` if the two arguments given are anagrams of each other; return `false` otherwise.

## Examples

```
"foefet" is an anagram of "toffee"

"Buckethead" is an anagram of "DeathCubeK"

"Twoo" is an anagram of "WooT"

apple" is not an anagram of "pale"

```

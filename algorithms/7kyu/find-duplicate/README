# Find duplicate

You are given an array of n+1 integers 1 through n. In addition there is a single duplicate integer.

The array is unsorted.

An example valid array would be `[3, 4, 1, 1, 5, 6].`

It has the integers 1 through 6 and 1 is duplicated. `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 5]` would not be valid as it is missing 6.

You should return the duplicate value as a single integer.

## Single Linked List

Single linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The list starts with a head node and ends with a tail node, where the tail node's next reference is null.

## Double Linked List

Double linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The list starts with a head node and ends with a tail node, where the tail node's next reference is null.
